This is a repository where I've decided to put my random Coq developents rather than
quitting coqide without saving. I do some interesting stuff... maybe not according
to a guru, but to me, and I figure I'd like to keep it around.

Someday I want to (help) make a really good theorem search engine, so it would be
nice to have a bunch of random unsorted theorems around for that project too :-)
